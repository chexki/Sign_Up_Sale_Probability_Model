# Sign_Up_Sale_Probability_Model
Part II - Learning patterns from users sign up forms to built a predictive algotithm - Extended Advanced Practice.
          Whether a person will buy a product or not !
                    
# Highlights
* Using Strong Statistics based data processing,
* Ensembled Machine Learning techniques used are, 
  1. KNN Classifier - Best fit Algorithm ( Minimizes Type II Error Effectively )
  2. Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier - Second best fit Algorithm ( Backs up the best fitting algorithm for good cases)
  3. KerasClassifier - Does not seem to fit well since the data is not enough.
  
to achive the highest possible accuracy amongst all the iterations this process has went through.

Note - 
* As the data and use case used for the above project is sensitive, the information is not disclosed here.
But, one can find the approch helpful to solve similar cases.
